			<p>Night Vale is known for its many different locations and diverse attractions that you won't be able to find anywhere else. Here is a list of some of them. Not ALL of them, mind you, but SOME of them.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>The Dog Park</h2>
			<p>Recently, the city council has opened a new dog park at the corner of Earl and Somerset, near the Ralph's. They would like to remind everyone that dogs are not allowed in the Dog Park. People are not allowed in the Dog Park. It is possible you will see Hooded Figures in the Dog Park. Do not approach them. <sec class="bold">Do not approach the Dog Park.</sec> The fence is electrified and highly dangerous. Try not to look at the Dog Park, and especially do not look for any period of time at the Hooded Figures. The Dog Park will not harm you.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>The Desert Flower Bowling Alley And Arcade Fun Complex</h2>
			<p>The Desert Flower Bowling Alley And Arcade Fun Complex is a wonderful place to do bowling, even if there is a tiny underground civilization under the pin retrieval area of Lane 5. Thankfully, the tiny undreground civilization has been recently covered up.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Big Rico's Pizza</h2>
			<p>After a strange incident leading to the destruction of all other pizza places, Big Rico's is the best place in Night Vale to get a slice of pizza. Even after our recent ban on all wheat and wheat byproducts, Big Rico's is still going strong with their new wheat-free recipe. Remember: Nobody does a slice like Big Rico's. <sec class="bold">Nobody.</sec></p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>The Brown Stone Spire</h2>
			<p>Are you lost? Don't know where to turn? Might I recommend <sec class="spire">THE BROWN STONE SPIRE</sec>. Do you need cash? Cast your eyes to <sec class="spire">THE BROWN STONE SPIRE</sec>. Alone, drowning in back taxes and legal problems? Look at <sec class="spire">THE BROWN STONE SPIRE</sec>. Night Vale's newest spire – built in the night several weeks ago by unknown agents, or aliens, or animals, or just our collective imagination – <sec class="spire">THE BROWN STONE SPIRE</sec> offers itself to all those who are down on their luck, or destitute, or simply being crushed by the consequences of their own maleficence. <sec class="spire">THE BROWN STONE SPIRE DOES NOT CARE. THE BROWN STONE SPIRE DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON PETTY MORALS.</sec> Divorce? Out of work? <sec class="spire">GIVE YOURSELF TO THE BROWN STONE SPIRE.</sec> You might be asking, how much does it cost to receive help from <sec class="spire">THE BROWN STONE SPIRE</sec>? I can assure you it does not cost any money. It costs...other things. But if you're concerned about what those costs are, then you are not in enough trouble for THE BROWN STONE <sec class="spire">SPIRE</sec>. You just need a lawyer. But if you are filled with glass shards of regret – THE B<sec class="spire">ROWN</sec> STONE <sec class="spire">SPI</sec>RE – or screaming impotently at an indifferent <sec class="stone">moon</sec>, then no need to look! <sec class="spire">THE BROWN STONE SPIRE WILL FIND YOU.</sec> THE <sec class="spire">B</sec>ROWN <sec class="spire">ST</sec>ONE <sec class="spire">S</sec>PIRE has a slogan. <sec class="stone">It cannot be pronounced.</sec></p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Hidden Gorge</h2>
			<p>While we'd love to tell you that hidden gorge is a wonderful place to visit and explain the incredible view that it has, we can't, because we've never actually seen it. You see, nobody actually knows where hidden gorge is, which is how it got its nickname: gorge.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>The House That Doesn't Exist</h2>
			<p>There is a house that doesn't actually exist. You can see it, and it's right inbetween two identical houses, so it would make more sense for it to be there than not, but according to Carlos, they've run several tests and all of them confirmed that the house isn't actually there. Nobody knows what it is, and nobody's brave enough to ring the doorbell.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>The Radio Station</h2>
			<p>And, of course, the very radio station that's broadcasting this very message to you right now. This place might be a little run down after station management got loose again, but it's still our home. If you want, you can even go see Khoshekh, the cat that's floating in a fixed position four feet in the air in the station restroom.</p>
