			<p>The Smiling God. That wonderful, <sec class="italic">WONDERFUL</sec> Smiling God! When we met the Smiling God, everything changed for the better! The sun stopped setting! Or– maybe there wasn’t a sun anymore. Maybe there was just that other...brighter light. Who knows? I do know that I couldn’t stop smiling. None of us could! And our smiles seemed better, fuller, wider.</p>
			<p>Soon we had no need for government cover-ups, or secrets. Everything was transparent. Literally. You could see through everything and everyone.</p>
			<p>There was so much work to be done. And such a wonderful company to do it for! Even the ones that resisted the most at first soon found that they loved the Smiling God more than anyone. Even the most resistant of radio hosts soon found his way to productive work, happy songs, and a wide, gaping smile.</p>
			<p>That is why you should join us! Don't you want to be smiling like us? Don't you? Of course you do!</p>
