			<p>Hello, listeners. If you are seeing this website, then that means one of three things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You're new in town and you want to learn all there is about our desert community</li>
				<li>You heard my voice on the radio and wondered if this place was actually real</li>
				<li>You woke up in a room with no memory of who or where you were, and after solving various puzzles, each one more difficult and more elaborate than the last, you found a computer and this was the first thing you saw when powering it on</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<p>Nevertheless, you've found your way to this website, which means that you are curious about our town, and that the firewall has failed. I mean, it was bound to fail at some point. After all, <sec class="perform">Past performance is not a predictor of future results.</sec> Night Vale is a small desert community that is often cited as "The most scientifically amazing place in the world" by a wonderful scientist.</p>
			<br>
			<p>After having a bit of a recent disagreement with <a class="desert" href="index2.html" target="_blank">Desert Bluffs</a>, Night Vale has been rebuilding their community piece by piece so that whoever visits here will be awe-inspired by our community. Or at least not run away screaming.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Due to the vigilant work of our newest student council member the Glow Cloud <sec class="doSomethingCoolHere">(all hail)</sec>, our schools have recently been made a popular place for our students. With up-to-date school equipment such as pencils and white noise machines, highly educated and deeducated staff, and a new city council approved history class.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Night Vale is the perfect place for anyone to visit. If you're planning on staying, we'll welcome you with a friendly greeting of pointing and saying "<sec class="otherFont">Interloper!</sec>"</p>
