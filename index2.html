			<p>Welcome! If you found this website, then that means that you're interested in our wonderful city! Desert Bluffs is a small community in the desert that will be happy to have you living with us! We're always so happy to have new visitors!</p>
			<p>Recently, we had a very unpleasant disagreement with our neighboring town of <a class="night" href="index.html" target="_blank">Nightvale</a>, because they don't seem to want to be one with our Smiling God. What a bunch of downers! You don't want to be downers like them, right? Of course you don't! Which is why you should come to our beautiful town of desert bluffs! We promise you will fit right in at our wonderful desert community!</p>
